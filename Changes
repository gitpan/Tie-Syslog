Revision history for Perl extension Tie::Syslog.

1.04  Thu Nov  9 16:43:49 EST 2000
    - Seems that you cannot undef $SIG{__DIE__}, nor assign undef
      to it without a warning. I could not figure out how to address
      this short of simply suppressing warnings in a little block.
    - I use $^S inside the $SIG{__DIE__} handler rather than poking
      back thru the stack looking for "(eval)".

    - Per Dustin Harris, allow setlogsock() options to be optionally
      passed to the tie() instead of hardwired to 'inet'.
    - Minor docs cleanup.

1.01  Fri Mar 12 17:21:46 EST 1999
